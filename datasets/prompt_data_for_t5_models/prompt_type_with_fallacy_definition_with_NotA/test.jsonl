It can include Abusive Ad Hominem (A pure attack on the character of the opponent. It often takes the form of 'My opponent is not a good person or has a bad trait, therefore his or her argument should not be accepted'), Tu Quoque Ad Hominem (Suggesting that because someone does not practice what they preach, their argument is invalid. It's analogous to a 'You did it first' 'You are just the same' or 'You are just as bad' kind of attack.), Bias Ad Hominem (Implying that the opponent is personally benefiting from his stance in the argument. That is, questioning the impartiality of the arguer), and Name-calling (Using derogatory language or offensive labels against the opponent to undermine an argument instead of addressing the content of the argument.)\nFear: Eliciting fear to support a claim.\nRidicule: Presenting an opponent's argument as absurd, ridiculous, or humorous. Mocking the opponent's point of view. A common instance is to use the expression 'That's crazy!' to dismiss an argument.\nFalse Dilemma: Presenting a situation as having only two alternatives, when in reality there are more options available. It oversimplifies a complex issue by reducing it to only two possible outcomes or choices, often in a way that excludes other possibilities, nuances, or middle-ground.\nHasty Generalization: Making a broad statement about a group or population based on a limited or unrepresentative sample. It usually follows the form: X is true for A, X is also true for B, therefore, X is true for C, D and E.\nLoaded Language: The use of words and phrases with strong connotations (either positive or negative) to influence an audience and invoke an emotional response.\n\nTweet:  [user27977]: Tiny case series study of 8 Covid infected cancer patients from Bangladesh: all were treated with ivermectin and doxycycline and became Rt-PCR negative in 6 days, allowing trouble-free cancer treatment resumption. \"very promising activity against COVID-19\" \n ", "target": "Ridicule", "binary_target": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}}
